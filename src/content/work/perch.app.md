# Product Positioning

People who read long-form content across many sources end up with fragmented workflows, duplicate feeds, and low signal discovery. Perch Reader is built to make high-signal writing easier to discover and consume by unifying blogs, RSS, Substacks, Beehiivs, and X articles into one personalized feed. The application offers a free core experience to maximize catalog growth and habit formation, while also offering premium AI chat and unlimited listening for power users.

# My Role

- Built the web, mobile, and backend applications from scratch
- Managed 4 engineers while staying hands-on in full stack delivery
- Owned architecture decisions across indexing, search, ranking, sync, and AI features
- Drove roadmap prioritization based on user feedback and retention signals

# Technical Stack

- Client apps: React (Next.js), React Native (Expo)
- API + backend: Node.js, Express, BullMQ, TypeScript
- Data + search: Supabase (Postgres), Redis, Elasticsearch
- Infrastructure: Railway, Cloudflare
- AI + media: ElevenLabs TTS, AI SDK (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini)
- Monetization: Stripe, RevenueCat

# Outcome

We built a product that a core group of users genuinely loved and paid for but ultimately decided to sunset the project. Between the decline of reading among the general public and the best writers paywalling their content the opportunity to build a sustainable business was limited. This was a great learning experience of taking a product from 0 to 1 and I'm proud of the product we built.
