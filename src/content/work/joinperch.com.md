Creator platform that turns audience questions into newsletters and SEO-friendly knowledge pages.

# Product Positioning

joinperch.com lets anyone host an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on their own domain with their own branding and automatically turns those answers into a weekly email digest audiences can subscribe to. It delivers many of the same benefits as a Substack or Beehiiv newsletter, but with a fraction of the work and a format that is more engaging and digestible for readers. Similar to Substack, creators own their mailing list, reducing dependence on third-party platforms like Instagram and Twitter. We also supported paywalled answers to create an additional revenue stream, similar to Patreon, while publishing SEO-friendly answer pages that compound long-tail discovery.

# My Role

- Built the product from zero to launch
- Led product and technical direction across creator UX, content pipeline, and monetization
- Owned architecture decisions across capture, publishing, subscription, and payment controls
- Drove delivery cadence with direct user feedback from active creators

# Technical Stack

- Client app: React (Next.js), TypeScript
- API + backend: Node.js, Express
- Data: AWS RDS (Postgres)
- Infrastructure: SendGrid (Email), AWS S3, Vercel
- Monetization: Stripe

# Outcome

joinperch.com reached meaningful early scale with over 1,000 creators and roughly 100K unique users, validating that creator Q&A can work as both a growth loop and a monetization engine. Creators are still using the product today.
