Creator platform that turns audience questions into newsletters and SEO-friendly knowledge pages.

## Project Snapshot
- Role: Co-Founder + CTO (hands-on)
- Built From: Scratch, from concept through launch and growth iteration
- Scale: 1,000+ creators, ~100K unique users
- Product Surface: Creator workflows, publishing pages, and owned audience infrastructure

## Problem + Positioning

### Problem
Creators needed a way to turn inbound audience questions into durable content, owned distribution, and direct monetization without complex editorial tooling.

### Positioning
Built to help creators grow owned distribution and monetize expertise through paywalls, bounties, and sponsorships.

### Product Strategy
- Turn audience demand (questions) into repeatable content supply (answers/newsletters)
- Build distribution creators own (email lists + indexable answer pages)
- Layer monetization directly into the same workflow to reduce operational overhead

## My Role + Ownership
- Built the product from zero to launch as Co-Founder + CTO
- Led product and technical direction across creator UX, content pipeline, and monetization
- Owned architecture decisions across capture, publishing, subscription, and payment controls
- Drove delivery cadence with direct user feedback from active creators

## Team + Leadership

### Team Composition
- Founding team led by me as player-coach CTO
- Add exact team composition here (engineering, product, design)

### Team Dynamic
- Tight product-engineering loops with frequent creator feedback sessions
- Fast experimentation on onboarding, publishing, and monetization flows
- Prioritized high-leverage features that improved both creator output and audience growth

### Management Scope
- Add exact reporting/mentorship scope here (who I managed directly)
- Set technical direction and implementation quality standards
- Balanced rapid shipping with reliability for public publishing surfaces

## Architecture + Technical Stack

### Core Stack
- TypeScript
- React (web)
- Node/Express backend
- SEO-first publishing surfaces
- Subscription and monetization controls

### Architecture Notes
- Built Q&A capture and publishing workflows from incoming question to live answer
- Shipped SEO-optimized answer pages for long-tail discovery and evergreen traffic
- Implemented subscription and monetization controls for free and paid creator offerings
- Optimized for practical full-stack iteration speed with tight feedback cycles

## Key Technical Challenges + Solutions

### Challenge 1: Reducing Friction from Question to Published Answer
- Context: Creators abandon workflows when intake-to-publish steps are fragmented.
- Solution: Built a unified capture and publishing pipeline with minimal operational overhead.
- Result: Faster creator output and more consistent publishing cadence.

Code snippet to add (capture-to-publish flow):
    // TODO: Add backend or workflow snippet showing question intake to publication state transition.

Screenshot to add:
- Creator question inbox
- Publish flow from draft to live answer

### Challenge 2: Building SEO-First Pages Without Sacrificing Creator UX
- Context: Growth required indexable content, but creators needed fast publishing UX.
- Solution: Implemented SEO-focused answer pages with metadata and URL structures aligned to discovery needs.
- Result: Durable discoverability and stronger long-tail audience acquisition.

Code snippet to add (SEO rendering/metadata):
    // TODO: Add snippet for metadata generation, canonical URLs, or structured page output.

Screenshot to add:
- Public answer page in search-friendly layout
- Creator preview with SEO settings

### Challenge 3: Monetization Embedded in Core Product Flow
- Context: Monetization features fail when they live outside normal creator workflows.
- Solution: Integrated paywalls, bounties, and sponsorship controls into content creation and audience funnels.
- Result: Creator Q&A became both a growth channel and monetization engine.

Code snippet to add (monetization control):
    // TODO: Add paywall/bounty/sponsorship rule snippet from backend or client flow.

Screenshot to add:
- Paywall setup experience
- Monetized answer view

## Outcomes + Impact
- 1,000+ creators onboarded
- ~100K unique users reading and asking questions
- Demonstrated that creator Q&A can function as both a growth and monetization engine

## Lessons Learned
- Products that combine workflow + distribution + monetization create stronger creator retention
- SEO compounds when answer quality and publishing consistency are both high
- Creator tools win when operational complexity is reduced, not expanded

## What I Would Do Next
- Add deeper creator analytics tied directly to revenue and conversion outcomes
- Expand collaboration features for teams publishing under one brand
- Formalize experimentation framework across onboarding and monetization funnels

## Links + Artifacts

- Add: onboarding funnel screenshot, SEO growth dashboard, and key PR links
