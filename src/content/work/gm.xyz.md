Crypto-native social network for communities built around tokens, NFTs, and DAOs.

# Overview

- **Role:** Co-Founder + CTO
- **Team:** **2** founders + **2** engineers + **1** designer
- **Scale:** **~30K** users
- **Product:** Web + iOS + Android(All platforms are now deprecated)

# Product Positioning

Web3 communities were operating in high-volume chat environments where signal was hard to preserve, discover, and moderate over time. gm.xyz was designed as an asynchronous, organized alternative to Discord-style chat so communities could find high-quality content faster. The strategy focused on ranking for signal quality, wallet-native identity, and stronger moderation controls.

# My Role

- Built the product from zero to launch
- Owned architecture and implementation across web, mobile, backend, and auth flows
- Set roadmap priorities based on adoption and engagement signals

# Technical Stack

- Client apps: React (web), React Native (mobile), TypeScript
- API + backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- Data: AWS RDS (Postgres), AWS S3
- Infrastructure: Qovery
- Identity + access: Sign in with Ethereum, OAuth, Google, Apple
- Monetization: Stripe

# Outcome

gm.xyz reached **~30K** users and taught us important go-to-market lessons:

- Crypto communities in the 2022-2023 cycle were not a durable wedge for bootstrapping a social network; many NFT cohorts were highly speculative and churned quickly.
- NFT and DAO segments often had weak LTV/CAC dynamics for our use case, with many groups behaving more like short-lived chats or small private workspaces.
- Even strong onboarding wins (for example, large NFT communities that initially used token-gated channels and reputation features as intended) still saw heavy member churn as attention moved to the next project.
- Token-gating, NFT integrations, and progressive decentralization were useful features, but not strong enough on their own to drive sustained mainstream adoption.
- The clearest long-term opportunity was creator- and interest-based communities with a persistent job-to-be-done, which directly informed our next product direction.
